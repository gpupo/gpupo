"Gilmar is undoubtedly an outstanding leader who, in a very humane way, manages to balance expectations and the freedom that remote work provides. Another point I must mention is his ability to build a culture of collaboration and the pursuit of common goals, even within the technology field.

"Working with Gilmar is always full of surprises. He is always in a good mood, whether it's early in the morning or late in the afternoon, Monday or Friday. He always brings something new, different, or just a simpler way of doing things. I remember countless situations where I was stuck on a problem, and he provided such a simple solution that it didn't even seem like a solution. The closer you get, the more you learn, not only about technology or the workplace but about various subjects like reading, cooking, music, and more. Undoubtedly, he's a 'Rodrigo Hilbert' with less beauty but much more intelligence and wisdom. Haha! During the time we worked together, my growth was exponential, and I am very grateful for that. It was a great pleasure to be part of the same team as him."
