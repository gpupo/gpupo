ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **Gilmar Pupo** â€” an IT executive with over 25 years of experience working at the intersection of technology and business strategy.

I started out as a web designer, evolved into a developer, project manager, CTO, strategic advisor, and currently serve as CEO. Along this journey, Iâ€™ve led digital transformation initiatives, software engineering teams, and innovation projects across companies and startups â€” always focused on operational efficiency, technical maturity, and aligning technology with business outcomes.

I'm passionate about helping small and mid-sized businesses unlock real value through data-driven decisions and scalable solutions. Iâ€™ve been recognized with multiple awards â€” including the Ebit for Best Online Store in Brazil â€” and am known for building high-performance teams, delivering innovative products, and fostering strong governance.

As a speaker, writer, and open-source contributor, I share insights on AI, productivity, software architecture, and digital transformation. I'm also the co-author of a book on recommendation systems and an active voice in the agile and free software communities.

My academic background includes degrees and certifications in IT Management, Information Security, Project Management, and a Strategic Business MBA â€” with credentials from institutions like Harvard, MIT, TUM, and Microsoft.

Above all, I believe in ethical innovation, custom-fit solutions, and the power of combining deep tech expertise with a human approach.
